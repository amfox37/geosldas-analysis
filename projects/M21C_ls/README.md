# M21C_ls

Land Sweeper (LS) diagnostics for the M21C campaign. Notebooks track LS assimilation performance, ObsFcstAna statistics, and validation at core sites; scripts support time-series generation.

## Key notebooks
- `notebooks/LS_insitu_plotter_102625.ipynb` – latest in situ comparison for multiple LS experiments.
- `notebooks/LS_ofa_figures_082725.ipynb` – builds OL vs DA figure packages (maps, time series) for LS runs.
- `notebooks/obsfcstana_ts_stats_LS_021725.ipynb` – ObsFcstAna time-series statistics for LS-specific experiments.

## Supporting scripts
- `scripts/LS_full_TS_insitu_plotter.py` – Python driver used to regenerate large sets of in situ plots outside of notebooks.
